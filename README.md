# Arduino-clocks
These sketches are for the CARC Electronics Workshops.
See the class notes for more information.

CARC is the Chattanooga Amateur Radio Club. Learn more about the club at https://www.w4am.net/ 

We will build several kinds of clocks, including ones based on NTP, GPS, and WWV time sources.
This Arduino project will get you experienced in building with Arduino and with interfacing various parts to an Arduino.
We will build this project in several steps.  If you acquire the parts in the Bill of Material, then you can also build these clocks.  I will first demonstrate the clocks and then we can hold a workshop where you can build your own clocks.
